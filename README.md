# Standup

Tired of having to click in things to access the same link everyday?
Damn, I was too...

Just clone the repo, change the URL link in the `standup.go` file, build standup


```
$ go build -o standup standup.go
```

and copy to `/usr/local/bin` so you can execute it anywhere

```
sudo cp standup /usr/local/bin/
```

and be happy.
